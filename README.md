>Procedure

```
1. Load the Dataset. 
2. Applying the Text Preprocessing to the given Dataset. 
3. Appling Different Encoders (Label Encoder) and Vectorization Techniques (TF-IDF, Count) to convert the words into vectors or numbers so that model can read them easily. 
4. Building a Pipeline. 
5. Applyin Different Machine Learning Techniques(Logistic Regression, Multinomial NB) to Train our model. 
6. Plotting graphic designs to visualize the results.
